# Mocha Workshop

This is a fully JavaScript sample project for demonstrating sync and async unit testing with `Mocha` and `NYC for` for tests coverage

In simple words, a `Test` is a piece of code written to ensure that our application or software works as we expect it to. Many developers including me use the `console.log()` util for performing manual testing, but, when software grows, we need to automate everything.

`Mocha` is a test runner, so, help us in detecting and running the tests in a good fashion way. The `NYC` tool delivers metrics to evaluate what is missing to test. (Test report)

This is a wide area to explore, but here's a basic hands-on experience.

## Usage

First: `npm install`
Second: `npm test`
